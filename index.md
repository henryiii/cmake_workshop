Welcome to the FIRST-HEP CMake tutorial! The aim of this tutorial is to cover the basics of using CMake. This tutorial is based on the online book [Modern CMake][], with a focus on CMake 3.14+. This is in what is [called the "More Modern" era](https://github.com/Bagira80/More-Modern-CMake) of CMake (which is 3.12+), and includes the fantastic command line improvements in CMake Ï€ (notes for 3.11+ compatible features will be included usually). We will cover the basics of making and building a project, and some details of design.

First taught at the [2019 USATLAS Computing Bootcamp at LBNL](https://smeehan12.github.io/2019-08-19-usatlas-computing-bootcamp/).

> ## Prereqs
>
> On your computer, you need to have:
>
> * `git`
> * `cmake` (Version 3.14 or newer). See the [instructions here][CMake Instructions].
> * A C++ compiler - system default is fine.
> * `make` or `ninja`
>
> A quick and minimal docker works well, too:
>
> ```bash
> docker run --rm -it alpine
> apk add git g++ cmake make
> git clone https://github.com/henryiii/cmake_workshop.git
> cd cmake_workshop
> ```
>
>
> This does *not* make a volume, so you will lose whatever you do in here when it exits - that's probably a good thing mostly.
